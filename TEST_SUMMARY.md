## ✅ Test Results Summary

**Total Tests: 21/21 passing** 🎉

### Test Coverage Areas

#### 🎯 ARMY_PRESETS Data Validation (4/4 tests)
- ✅ Contains 15+ comprehensive army presets
- ✅ All presets have valid structure with required properties  
- ✅ All stat values are within valid ranges (1-10)
- ✅ Includes expected historical armies (SAS, US Marines, Roman Legion, etc.)

#### ⚔️ calculateArmyPower Function (6/6 tests)
- ✅ Calculates power correctly for basic armies
- ✅ Higher stats result in higher power
- ✅ Home advantage applies correctly (+10% per level)
- ✅ Visitor disadvantage applies correctly (-10% per level)
- ✅ Power scales proportionally with army size
- ✅ Handles edge cases (zero size, min/max stats)

#### 🎲 runSimulation Function (5/5 tests)
- ✅ Returns proper simulation structure (results + winners)
- ✅ Handles multiple army counts correctly
- ✅ Determines winners consistently based on power
- ✅ Handles empty armies list gracefully
- ✅ Handles single army scenarios

#### 📝 summarizeArmy Function (2/2 tests)
- ✅ Creates readable army summaries with all stats
- ✅ Handles different army configurations properly

#### 🔧 Integration Tests (2/2 tests)
- ✅ Complete simulation workflow using real preset armies
- ✅ Complex multi-army scenarios with different counts

#### 🚀 Performance Tests (2/2 tests)
- ✅ Large simulations (10 armies) complete efficiently (< 100ms)
- ✅ 100 simulation runs complete quickly (< 1 second)

## 🎮 Tested Army Presets

The test suite validates all 20 historical armies including:

- **Special Forces**: SAS (UK), US Marines, IDF (Israel)
- **Historical**: Roman Legion, Spartan Hoplites, Mongol Horde
- **WWII Era**: WW2 Germany, Soviet Union, US Army, British Army
- **Modern**: US Army (Modern), Russian Army (Modern), PLA (China)
- **Unique**: Ninjas, Samurai, Zulu Warriors, French Foreign Legion

## 🧪 Test Architecture

### Core Components Tested:
1. **Data Validation**: Army preset structure and value ranges
2. **Battle Mechanics**: Power calculation with all stat influences
3. **Simulation Logic**: Multi-army battles with proper winner determination
4. **Performance**: Efficiency under load with large army counts
5. **Integration**: End-to-end workflows using real data

### Test Methodology:
- **Statistical Testing**: Multiple iterations to account for randomness
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Zero values, extreme stats, empty inputs
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Timing constraints for realistic usage
- **Real Data Integration**: Uses actual army presets for realistic testing
